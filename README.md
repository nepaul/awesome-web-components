- <img src="https://img.shields.io/github/stars/lerna/lerna?style=social" height="16"> [Lerna: A tool for managing JavaScript projects with multiple packages.](https://github.com/lerna/lerna)

  Splitting up large codebases into separate independently versioned packages is extremely useful for code sharing. However, making changes across many repositories is messy and difficult to track, and testing across repositories becomes complicated very quickly.
  
  To solve these (and many other) problems, some projects will organize their codebases into multi-package repositories (sometimes called monorepos). Projects like Babel, React, Angular, Ember, Meteor, Jest, and many others develop all of their packages within a single repository.

  Lerna is a tool that optimizes the workflow around managing multi-package repositories with git and npm.

  Lerna can also reduce the time and space requirements for numerous copies of packages in development and build environments - normally a downside of dividing a project into many separate NPM packages. See the hoist documentation for details.

  Emscripten provides Web support for popular portable APIs such as OpenGL and SDL2, allowing complex graphical native applications to be ported, such as the Unity game engine and Google Earth. It can probably port your codebase, too!

  While Emscripten mostly focuses on compiling C and C++ using Clang, it can be integrated with other LLVM-using compilers (for example, Rust has Emscripten integration, with the wasm32-unknown-emscripten and asmjs-unknown-emscripten targets).
